    <p>A classic recipe of one of the most loved foods in the world. The ultimate comfort food = homemade lasagna. Family and friends gather around the dinner table at any time for this lasagna recipe. A big warm comforting hug within layers of pasta, tomato sauce, white sauce and melted cheese!.</p>
    
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that's like a savory hug on a plate. Imagine broad, flat sheets of pasta layered with a rich, chunky tomato sauce (often a ragù), creamy béchamel sauce, and gooey melted cheeses like ricotta and mozzarella. In between these layers, you might find savory fillings like seasoned ground meat, roasted vegetables, or even spinach. The lasagna is then baked until the edges are crisp, the cheese is bubbly, and everything is melded together into a warm, satisfying masterpiece.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef – We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna.
        <li>Onion – we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves – you can add more if you love garlic</li>
        <li>Red wine (or beef broth) – This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce – Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
        <li>Dried thyme – Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
        <li>Sugar – balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li></li>
    </ul>
